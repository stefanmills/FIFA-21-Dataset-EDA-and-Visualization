### Introduction
This repository contains Python code and data files for cleaning and visualizing FIFA 21 player data. The dataset includes various attributes of football players such as their personal information, physical attributes, skill ratings, contract details, and more.

### Title
**Title:** FIFA 21 Player Dataset Data Cleaning and Visualization

### Description
In this project, we have performed comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on FIFA 21 player data. The dataset was initially messy and required several steps to clean and prepare it for analysis. We also visualized key insights to gain a better understanding of the data.

### Steps Taken
1. **Importing Data:** Loaded the raw FIFA 21 player data along with additional datasets containing country and club information.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted an initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and data types.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Implemented various cleaning steps including handling duplicates, splitting columns, removing unnecessary characters, converting data types, and more.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Created new columns such as years spent at the club, years left on contract, etc., to provide additional insights.
5. **Visualization:** Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize key relationships and trends within the data.

### Files
- **fifa21_raw_data.csv:** Raw dataset containing FIFA 21 player data.
- **Country_Continent.csv:** Dataset mapping countries to continents.
- **teamlist.csv:** Dataset providing information about football club teams.
- **fifa_21_cleaned_data.csv:** Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

### Contents
1. **FIFA 21.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning and feature engineering.
2. **README.md:** Markdown file providing an overview of the project, its purpose, and the steps involved.
3. **fifa_21_cleaned_data.csv:** Cleaned dataset in CSV format.
4. **Images:** Folder containing visualizations generated during the analysis.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `FIFA 21.ipynb` to view the data cleaning process and execute the code if needed.
3. Access the cleaned dataset `fifa_21_cleaned_data.csv` for further analysis or visualization.
4. Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements.

### Conclusion
The FIFA 21 Player Data Cleaning and Visualization project provide insights into the process of cleaning and analyzing messy real-world datasets. By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can understand how to handle data inconsistencies, perform feature engineering, and visualize data to extract valuable insights.
